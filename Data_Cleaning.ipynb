Amiodarone 200 mg po q.d.\\n10.  Coumadin 1 mg q.d.\\n\\nADMISSION LABORATORIES:  CBC with a white blood cell count of\\n6.9, poly 72, lymphocytes 18, hematocrit 33, platelets 255,\\nBUN 9, creatinine 3.4, K 3.5.  Echocardiogram done in\\n[**Month (only) 956**] showed normal ejection fraction with mitral\\nregurgitation and aortic regurgitation noted.\\n\\nThe patient was begun on Vanco, Levo and Flagyl antibiotics.\\nCoumadin was continued.  Protonix was continued and vascular\\nwas consulted regarding management.  Vascular examination\\nshowed a pleasant male in no acute distress.  HEENT\\nexamination was unremarkable.  carotids were without bruits.\\nHeart was a regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were\\ndiminished at the right base and abdominal examination had a\\npalpable aortic aneurysm.  The foot examination showed a left\\nfoot cold with ischemic appearing black ulceration on the\\nleft medial heel and ankle with no erythema, fluctuance or\\ndrainage.  The pulse examination showed palpable femorals on\\nthe right, dopplerable on the left.  Popliteal was\\ndopplerable on the right, absent on the left.  The dorsalis\\npedis pulses were absent bilaterally.  The patient PT was\\ndopplerable on the right and absent on the left.  The foot\\nx-ray showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.  Arteriogram on\\n[**2113-3-30**] showed a abdominal aortic aneurysm with a left common\\niliac aneurysm with plaque.  The distal superficial femoral\\nartery, popliteal and BK [**Doctor Last Name **] diseased, the single vessel run\\noff via the peroneal was reconstituted to the dorsalis pedis\\npulse.  There was no posterior tibial pulse.\\n\\nRecommendations were to hold his Coumadin, normalize his INR,\\nbegin heparinization for goal PTT between 40 and 60, obtain\\nMRI/MRA of the left leg and the aorta to evaluate the aorta\\nand in flow disease, consider cardiac workup with\\nechocardiogram and PMIBI, continue antibiotics broad\\nspectrum, follow culture results and tailor as necessary.\\nMultipodus splint to the right foot to prevent heel\\nulcerations.  Echocardiogram was obtained, which demonstrated\\nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  This was a\\nsuboptimal technical quality study, so focal wall motion\\ncould not be excluded.  The overall ventricular function EF\\nwas greater then 55%.  There was a mild aortic stenosis and\\nmitral leaflets appeared thickened, but they were unable to\\nadequately assess the mitral regurgitation.  There was mild\\npulmonary hypertension.  Compared to previous study on\\n[**2113-1-18**] there is probably a similar aortic gradient that is\\nslightly higher.  The patient underwent a PMIBI.  There were\\nno anginal or ischemic changes, but the patient did have\\npremature ventricular contractions and premature atrial\\ncontractions.  His nuclear portion showed an abnormal study\\nwith severe fixed defect involving the basilar portion of the\\ninferior wall.  The ejection fraction was calculated at 54%\\nand on visual inspection it is in the range of 65 to 70.\\n\\nMedical attending evaluated the patient and a moderate\\ncardiac risk for surgery.  The patient had a CTA of the\\nabdomen and pelvis to determine abdominal aortic aneurysm.\\nFindings demonstrated intrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm of\\n4.9 by 5.2 cm.  There is an aneurysm of the right proximal\\ncommon iliac artery, which measures 4.1 by 2.9 cm.  There is\\nan aneurysm of the left common iliac, which measures 1.7 by\\n2.5 cm.  There is an aneurysm in the proximal right internal\\niliac artery, which measures 1.4 to 2.0.  There is dense\\nvascular calcification and multiple venous collaterals seen\\nalong the anterior subcutaneous tissues of the abdomen with\\ncollateral flow to the right common femoral vein.  There is\\nmoderate stenosis of the right external iliac artery.  The\\nceliac superior mesenteric arteries are patent.  There is\\ndense calcification involving the ostium of the left renal\\nartery and dense calcifications at the origin of the right\\nrenal artery.  There are extensive venous intercostal\\ncollaterals along the anterior abdominal wall.  These\\nfindings are consistent with severe vena cava occlusion.  The\\nright inguinal hernia contains small bowel.  There is no\\nevidence of obstruction.  Incidentally there was gallstones\\nin the gallbladder.  Bilateral adrenal enlargement may\\nrepresent adrenal hyperplasia.  Diverticulosis without\\nevidence of diverticulitis.  The patient underwent an\\nabdominal aortic angio with left leg run off.  There showed\\nsignificant infrarenal aortic atherosclerotic changes with\\naneurysmal dilatation extending to the common iliac.  There\\nis diffuse atherosclerotic ulcerative plaque of the bilateral\\nexternal and internal iliac arteries.  There is severe\\ndisease of the left superficial femoral artery, which\\noccluded at the adductor canal.  The left PFA is occluded and\\nabove and below knee popliteal arteries are occluded.  There\\nis reconstruction of a diffusely diseased attenuated\\nperoneal, which reconstitutes the dorsalis pedis.\\n\\nAfter careful review of the arteriogram and CTA a long\\ndiscussion with the patient's daughter and the patient was\\ndetermined being as a high risk and his comorbidities and\\nrecommendations were a left below the knee amputation.  The\\npatient consented to that and underwent on [**2113-4-27**] a left\\nbelow the knee amputation. He tolerated the procedure well\\nand he was transferred to the PAC in stable condition.  He\\nremained hemodynamically stable.  He was transferred to the\\nVICU for continued monitoring and care.  Initial dressing was\\nremoved on postoperative day number two.  The wound was\\nclean, dry and intact.  The skin edges were intact with no\\necchymosis and no drainage.  Physical therapy and\\noccupational therapy began to work with the patient.  renal\\ncontinued to follow the patient for hemodialysis needs.\\nPercocet caused the patient to be confused so he was started\\non Tylenol #3.  Renal recommended that the patient only\\nreceive narcotics a single dose q 24 hours supplement the\\npatient's break through pain with extra strength Tylenol\\ntablets two q 4 to 6 hours prn for pain.  The remaining\\nhospitalization was unremarkable.  The patient was discharged\\nto rehab.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1.  Amiodarone 200 mg po q.d.\\n2.  Nephrocaps one q.d.\\n3.

It cannot be\\ndecided\\nwhether the described findings have any relevance to\\ntherapeutically-induced\\nfluid overload.\\n.\\nECHO [**2180-11-3**]: Conclusions\\nOverall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).\\nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.\\nThere is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears\\ncircumferential. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with\\nblood, inflammation or other cellular elements.\\nIMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion.\\nBilateral pleural effusions.\\n\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\n52 year old woman with a PMH significant for metastatic breast\\ncancer with lung and brain metastases admitted originally to the\\n[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of respiratory distress, then transferred to\\nCCU after pericardiocentesis for cardiac tampoande, then\\ntransferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 2035**] after pt's respiratory status stabilized.\\n.\\n#. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: On presentation to the ICU, the\\npatient denied any fevers but reported a productive cough of\\nseveral months duration. CXR on arrival demonstrated left\\nperi-hilar and basilar infiltrates with concern for infectious\\nconsolidation/pneumonia, pleural effusion or progression of\\nmetastatic disease as her cancer was known to be located in the\\nleft lower lobe. A CT with contrast was performed to further\\nevaluate the intrapulmonary process and demonstrated a\\nmultifocal pneumonia, progression of the pulmonary metastases,\\npleural effusions as well as a moderate-to-large pericardial\\neffusion (see below for management of pericardial effusion) but\\nwas negative for a pulmonary embolism. Given productive cough\\nand radiographic evidence the patient was started on Levaquin\\nand Vancomycin for robust CAP treatment. On review of her\\nmedical chart, HCAP was considered more likely and she was\\nstarted on Levoquin and Cefipime. Blood and urine cultures were\\nperformed and showed no growth as well as an Influenza DFA,\\nwhich was negative. The patient was maintained on oxygen by\\nnasal canula to maintain an oxygen saturation greater than 90%.\\nUrine culture showed no growth though UA was positive for\\nleukocytes, as she was already on broad spectrim antibiotics, no\\nadditional coverage was added. Antibiotics were changed to\\nLevaquin and flagyl to cover postobstructive pneumonia, she will\\nfinish a course of 8 days on [**2180-11-8**]. On [**10-31**], patient spiked\\nfever to 100.9 and cefipime was restarted. After arrival to\\n[**Name (NI) 2035**], pt remained afebrile and cultures were negative, so\\nCepfepime was dc'd again.  Pulmonary was consulted and per their\\nrecs, Vanc was restarted and Flagyl was dc'd after 5 days.  Pt\\nultimately completed 8d of Levoquin and at time of discharge,\\nVanc was changed to Linezolid to complete the course at home.\\nCough was treated symptomatically.  Pt was discharged with O2\\nsuppl.\\n.\\n#. Pericardial Effusion: Patient was tachycardic on\\npresentation. There was concern that it may be related to the\\npatient's hypoxia or another underlying process such as a PE or\\npossibly hypovolemia. Antibiotics for her pneumonia as above.\\nIntravenous fluids were given for hypovolemia with little change\\nin heart rate. A CT was ordered as above to evaluate further,\\nwhich was negative for a pulmonary embolism but did reveal a\\nmoderate-to-large pericardial effusion. A TTE was ordered to\\nevaluate further and revealed evidence of tamponade physiology.\\nMoreover, the patient had a pulsus paradoxus of 16-18 mm Hg on\\nexam. The interventional cardiology service was contact[**Name (NI) **] who\\nperformed pericardiocentesis which produced 470mL serosanguanous\\nfluid which was consistent with exudate by lites criteria. Over\\nthe next day, the drain put out another 500cc of fluid. The\\nfluid was sent for cultures which were all negative.  Cytology\\non pericarial fluid was positive for malignant cells. After one\\nday, the pericardial drain was pulled, and the tip sent for\\nculture which was also negative, and the patient was transfered\\nout of the CCU. After arrival to [**Name (NI) 2035**], pt remained stable on NC,\\nhowever clinically appeared still distressed.  On [**2180-11-3**], a\\nrepeat ECHO was performed and it showed small pericardical\\neffusion, reassuring us that the fluid had not reaccumulated.\\nPer Cardiology recs, pt was instrusted to get another repeat\\nECHO on [**2180-11-22**] when she return for her outpt appt with\\noncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] will follow-up on the ECHO\\nresults.\\n.\\n# Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Patient presented with a mild\\nmetabolic acidosis and an anion gap of 15. The most immediate\\nconcern was for a lactic acidosis from her respiratory distress\\nand impaired tissue oxygenation or a possible starvation\\nketosis. Repeat labs the morning after admission revealed a\\nworsening of her acidosis with a HCO3 of 15 (down from 20 on\\nadmission). An ABG revealed an appropriate respiratory\\ncompensation with a pCO2 of 31. The metabolic acidosis soon\\nresolved and pt remained stable.\\n.\\n# Breast cancer: CT on admission showed dramatic progression of\\nmetastatic disease involving the lungs bilaterally. She was\\ncontinued on capecitabine 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **], and transfered to the\\noncology service. Once on [**Hospital1 2035**], given pt's breast cancer was\\nprogressing on current therapy (CA27-29 rising) and pt's\\nclinical status was deteriorating, inpt attending and outpt\\noncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] discussed started a new chemotherapy\\nregimen.  Thus, pt's capecitabine was stopped and on [**2180-11-3**] pt\\nwas given Herceptin, Docetaxel and Carboplatin.  20 minutes into\\nthe infusion, Herceptin was stopped bc pt developed SOB and\\nhypoxia to mid 80s.  Pt's symptoms resolved with time, Ativan\\nand Lasix.  Herceptin was attempted again on [**2180-11-6**].  This\\ntime the infusion was stopped 60 min into the infusion bc pt\\ndeveloped tachycardia. Pt's symptoms resolved with time.  Pt was\\nstarted on Neupogen 24 hours after chemotherapy administration\\nto prevent neutropenia.  The Neupogen was discontinued on day of\\ndischarge as pt's WBC was still >15.\\n.\\n# Elevated LFTs: Pt had midly elevated LFTs after chemo\\nadministration, which were trending down with time.\\n.\\n# Diarrhea:  Pt developed diarrhea during the hospitalization.\\nC diff was negative.  Likely [**12-28**] chemo.  Diarrhea improved with\\nImodium.\\n.\\n# Anemia: Hematocrit on admission was approximately 39, at the\\npatient's known baseline. The patient subsequently received\\nseveral liters of intravenous fluids for her tachycardia and her\\nhematocrit came down to 35. Pt's Hct remained stable in the\\n31-35 range.  Pt did not require any transfusions.\\n.\\n# Crohn's: Patient was continued on her Mesalamine without\\nevent.\\n.\\n# Pt was on regular diet.  Pt was full code.
